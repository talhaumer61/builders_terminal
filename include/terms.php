        <h2 class="fw-bold">6. Ranking</h2>
        <p class="pol-text">
            6.1. The display of your Trade Account in the profile search is ranked by us using an algorithm based on various parameters. We have set out below the main parameters taken into account in order to improve the predictability of the ranking and help you optimise the presentation of your Trade Account and services. The following parameters determine your ranking and are set out below in order of importance and weighting applied:
        </p>
        <p class="pol-text container">
            6.1.1. Relevance: only those Tradespeople who offer the specific trades and/or services requested in a particular Job are displayed in the ranking list
        </p>
        <p class="pol-text container">
            6.1.2. Geographical proximity: it is generally important for the Customer to find a Tradesperson who is not too far away from the location of the Job, because a short distance usually leads to faster availability of the Tradesperson and lower costs for the Customer.
        </p>
        <p class="pol-text container">
            6.1.3. Customer Feedback: Feedback from Customers can be a valuable indication for the Customer as to whether these Customers have been satisfied with your services and behaviour in the past. The better your rating, the higher up you will appear in the ranking for the Customer.
        </p>
        <p class="pol-text container">
            6.1.4. Interactions with Customers: your activity on the Builders Terminal Platform can indicate how quickly you Express Interest in Leads, Shortlisting and other communications. We therefore evaluate how many replies you sent in the week before the Job was created by the Customer and whether these replies related to comparable Jobs. The higher the number of answers, the higher up you will appear in the ranking for the Customer.
        </p>
        <p class="pol-text container">
            6.1.5. Randomisation: we want to ensure that even Tradespeople who have only been active on the Builders Terminal Platform for a short time and therefore have a lower chance of scoring on the other ranking parameters have a chance of getting the Job. We therefore allow a Tradesperson who has been active on the Builders Terminal Platform for 2 months or less to be ranked higher than they otherwise would be based on our ranking parameters. This is a purely random selection of the Tradesperson and the place that they appear except for them appearing higher than they otherwise might be. These new Tradespeople will also be ranked according to the main parameters mentioned above.
        </p>
        <p class="pol-text">
            6.2. Neither the ranking we carry out nor your position in any ranking can be influenced directly or indirectly by the payment of any fees.
