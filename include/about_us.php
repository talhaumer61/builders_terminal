            <p>There are plenty of tradespeople out there, but finding a good one is like looking for a needle in a haystack. At Builders Terminal, we take the hassle out of finding the right tradesperson with our unique matchmaking system. Once your job is posted, we alert relevant tradespeople and those interested get in touch. You see full work history and customer feedback comments, helping you choose the best builder for your job.</p>
            <p>"It is difficult getting a builder and more difficult getting a builder you like. Builders Terminal helps with that process."</p>
            <p>And if you think life is any easier for builders looking for work, think again. Finding clients can seem like an impossible task and traditional advertising and directories almost never works. The trades need to focus on doing great work for their customers, without having to worry about where the next job will come from. Builders Terminalâ€™s feedback system means that today client helps MyBuilder tradespeople win tomorrow work.</p>

            <h4 class="fw-bold">History</h4>
            <p>Ryan Notz, a stonemason and roofer working in Bristol, dreamed of a better way to find work back in 2004 by giving consumers a way to find local, reliable builders. He immediately set out to make his dream come true by setting up an office in his garage. After two years, a few false starts and a lot of late nights, MyBuilder was launched.</p>
            <p>Since then, we have helped hundreds of thousands of homeowners choose the right builder for their project; and we have ensured that thousands of tradespeople all over the country have a steady stream of work.</p>
            <p>Inspired by Ryan vision, we are still working hard to make sure MyBuilder is the single best way for homeowners to choose great builders and for great builders to succeed.</p>
